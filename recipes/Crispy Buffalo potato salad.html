        <li>1/4 cup Buffalo hot sauce, divided </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes; drain.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or foil.</li>

        <li> Coat the prepared baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add potatoes in a single layer onto the pan. Using a heavy bottomed jar or glass, smash potatoes to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness, taking care not to fully separate the potatoes. Drizzle smashed potatoes evenly with remaining oil; sprinkle with remaining teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and garlic powder.</li>

        <li> Roast potatoes in the preheated oven, until very crispy and browned, 30 to 35 minutes, flipping  after 25 minutes. </li>

        <li>While potatoes are roasting, prepare the dressing. Combine sour cream, mayonnaise and ranch seasoning.  Reserve 1 tablespoon green onion, celery, blue cheese and bacon  for garnish; add remaining green onions, celery, blue cheese and bacon to sour cream mixture. Stir well to combine.</li>

        <li> Add cooked potatoes to dressing bowl and drizzle with 3 tablespoons hot sauce.  Toss mixture together til well coated.  Transfer to a serving bowl and top with reserved green onions, celery,  blue cheese, and bacon and drizzle with remaining buffalo sauce.  Serve room temp or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve</li>
